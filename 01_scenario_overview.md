## Scenario Overview

A SIEM alert was generated for the execution of a process from the `/tmp` directory on a Linux database server. The alert was classified as high severity due to execution from a world-writable location on a critical production host. An investigation was initiated to determine whether the activity was benign or indicative of system compromise.
