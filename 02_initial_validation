## Initial Validation

Initial validation focused on determining whether the execution was user-initiated or system-initiated. The process context was reviewed to identify the executing user and parent process, confirming the activity was not associated with an interactive user session. The execution behavior was assessed to determine whether it originated from automation rather than legitimate administrative activity. Based on these checks, the activity was deemed abnormal and required deeper investigation.
