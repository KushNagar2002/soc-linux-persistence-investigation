## Response Decision & Recommendation

Based on the confirmed presence of root-level persistence, containment is recommended to limit further damage while preserving forensic evidence. Network isolation of the affected host should be considered to prevent external communication without immediately removing artifacts. Eradication should be deferred until Incident Response completes a full forensic analysis to determine the initial entry point and assess for additional persistence mechanisms. The incident should be escalated to the Incident Response team with all collected evidence.
