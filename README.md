# SOC Incident Investigation: Root-Level Persistence via systemd Timer

This project documents a real-world style Security Operations Center (SOC) investigation involving a Linux database server where a systemd timer was abused to maintain root-level persistence and execute externally sourced payloads from a temporary directory.

The investigation follows a Tier-1 SOC workflow, including alert validation, process and persistence analysis, malicious script behavior identification, impact assessment, and evidence-based escalation to Incident Response.

# Key SOC Skills Demonstrated
- Linux process and parent-child analysis
- Detection of systemd-based persistence mechanisms
- Analysis of malicious loader behavior
- Evidence preservation and timeline reconstruction
- Impact and scope assessment
- SOC escalation and incident documentation

This project reflects practical SOC analyst responsibilities rather than theoretical lab exercises.
